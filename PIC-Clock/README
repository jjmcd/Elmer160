A simple clock for the PIC-EL

This little C program, along with the LCD routines from
Elmer 160, provides a simple 24-hour clock for the PIC-EL.

The program is quite crude, with few features.  In particular,
there is no way to actually set the clock.  The timing may
vary from PIC-EL to PIC-EL, so a manifest constant is provided
to adjust the speed for the particular crystal.  Since this
is a little coarse, a small trimmer in parallel with one of
the capacitors would be an improvement, but it needs to be
quite a small value.
