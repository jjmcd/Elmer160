Little program to exercise SDCC

Program flashes the 3 PIC-EL LEDs and an LED plugged into the
transmitter port in an erratic fashion.  The PIC-EL LEDs are red and
get a different treatment than the xmit LED.  The LED plugged into the
xmit port is white.

This is an intiial test for the Candle04 program.

This version uses the PIC16F88 with its internal oscillator set to
31.25 kHz
