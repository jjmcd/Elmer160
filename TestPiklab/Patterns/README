Generate code for LED patterns

This is NOT a PIC program.

When making some candle simulations, it is useful to have LEDs
flashing erratically, but complete randomness is not desireable
because we want to have at least one LED on at all times.  This
program, which is intended to run on a PC, generates both C and
assembler code for a series of bytes to write to PORTB on the 
PIC-EL.
