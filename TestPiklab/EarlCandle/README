N8ERO Candle Simulation

This is a candle simulation written by N8ERO.  It is one of the few
programs in this folder in assembler.  It was used here as an
assembler test for Piklab.  The program again flashes LEDs
erratically.  On this one, only one LED may be off at a time.  Here
not only is the "off" LED random, but the length of time between
changes is also random.  For a realistic candle simulation capacitors
are required on the LEDs.

Earl originally wrote the application for the PIC16F716.  because that
part is not supported by Piklab, the application was modified for the
PIC16F84A.
