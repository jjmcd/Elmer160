Functions borrowed from earlier lessons

ConvBCD2 - input - 2-byte location "binary"
           output - 5-byte location "digits"

           Converts 16 bit value to decimal ASCII - developed
           in Lesson 18

InitTMR0 - Code borrowed but not function.  Enables timer
           with rising edge and 1:256 prescaler. Concepts introduced
           in Lesson 13

The following functions are from LCDlib - these functions have been
used over and over throughout the lessons, and in Lesson 17, we
walked through their development.

LCDinit - initializes the LCD.  Must be called before any other
           LCD routine.  Also initializes the port, including
           turning off A/D and comparator where relevant.

LCDsend - Sends the command in W to the LCD

LCCclear - Erases the LCD

LCDzero - Moves the LCD cursor to position zero
