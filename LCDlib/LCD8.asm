;
;  Set the LCD DDRAM address to 8.
;
;  This function sets the DDRAM address of the LCD
;  to 8.  The DDRAM address determines where in the LCD
;  memory the next character will be displayed.
;
;  Setting the DDRAM address to 8 causes the next
;  character to appear at the right-hand side of
;  an 8 character display.  This is useful for
;  scrolling characters across the display from
;  right to left.
;
;  The contents of the W register are ignored by
;  this routine.  The contents of the W register
;  are destroyed on exit.
