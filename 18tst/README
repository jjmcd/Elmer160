Simple PIC18 exercises

This folder contains a number of simple programs for the PIC18F1320 on
the PIC-EL.  Programs mostly flash LEDs and exercise the LCD library.
Note that this version of the LCD library has been modified to work
with the pinout of the 18F parts which is different than the 16F PICs.
