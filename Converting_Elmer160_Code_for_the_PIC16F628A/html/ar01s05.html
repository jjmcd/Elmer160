			The <span class="application"><strong>PIC16F628A</strong></span> has thirty-three Special Function Registers in four banks. Six of these are echoed in all banks; the same six as in the <span class="application"><strong>PIC16F84A</strong></span>.
		</div><div class="para">
			However, those registers that are not in all the banks are not always in the same banks as the <span class="application"><strong>PIC16F84A</strong></span>. Fortunately, the most commonly used registers are. <code class="code">PORTA</code>, <code class="code">TRISA</code>, <code class="code">PORTB</code> and <code class="code">TRISB</code> are all found in their familiar locations.

			 Unfortunately, even this isn't as simple as it sounds. The <code class="code">TRIS</code> registers are in bank 1, as in the 84. But, the student is likely to put most of his data in bank 0. On the 84, data in bank 0 also appears in bank 1, but that isn't the case in the <span class="application"><strong>PIC16F628A</strong></span>. The data in bank 1 is different data than in bank 0. Typically the programmer only sets the <code class="code">TRIS</code> registers once in the program, and usually immediately switches back to bank 0. In most cases, there is no need for the data at the time the <code class="code">TRIS</code> registers are set up.
		</div><div class="para">
			However, there are cases where they student may well want to modify the <code class="code">TRIS</code> registers during the execution of the program. In those cases, the student must take care to recognize that data in bank 0 is not available at the same time as the TRIS register is visible.
		</div><div class="para">
			Things get more interesting with the EEPROM. In the <span class="application"><strong>PIC16F84A</strong></span>, the <code class="code">EEDATA</code> and <code class="code">EEADR</code> registers are in bank 0, while the <code class="code">EECON1</code> and <code class="code">EECON2</code> registers are in bank 1. This works our reasonably well as the programmer generally needs access to data when dealing with <code class="code">EEDATA</code> and <code class="code">EEADR</code>, but not the others. On the <span class="application"><strong>PIC16F628A</strong></span>, however, all these registers are in bank 1. This not only means that the <code class="code">banksel</code> directives need to be moved around when converting code, the the student must be alert to where the settings are as data is manipulated.

			Consider the following code for the <span class="application"><strong>PIC16F84A</strong></span>: 
<pre class="screen">
Loop
        movf            Location, W     ; Location in EEPROM
        movwf           EEADR           ; Set the EEPROM address
        banksel         EECON1          ; Select bank for EECON1
        bsf             EECON1,RD       ; Initiate read
        banksel         EEDATA          ; Back to bank 0
        movf            EEDATA,W        ; Pick up the data
        movwf           Target          ; and store it off
        incf            Location,F      ; Point to next EEPROM loc
        decfsz          Index,F         ; Count down
        goto            Loop            ; Go do next location
</pre>
			 The corresponding code for the <span class="application"><strong>PIC16F628A</strong></span> has a number of differences, both in the location and targets of the <code class="code">banksel</code> directives: 
<pre class="screen">
Loop
        movf            Location, W     ; Location in EEPROM
        banksel         EEADR           ; Select bank for EE regs
        movwf           EEADR           ; Set the EEPROM address
        bsf             EECON1,RD       ; Initiate read
        movf            EEDATA,W        ; Pick up the data
        banksel         Target          ; Back to bank 0
        movwf           Target          ; and store it off
        incf            Location,F      ; Point to next EEPROM loc
        decfsz          Index,F         ; Count down
